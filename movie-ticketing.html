        <h1>THE PROBLEM</h1>
  
    <div class="prob">
        <p class="para-1">The problem for a mobile ticketing app for a movie theater is that customers often face long lines at the theater, 
            especially during peak hours, to purchase tickets and confused in seating layout. This can be frustrating for customers 
            who are looking to purchase tickets quickly and efficiently.</p>
        <p class="para-2">To better understand our target audience and their requirements, we performed user research. We surveyed and interviewed actual moviegoers and examined data from existing movie ticketing applications. 
            We went into the research with some assumptions, such as that users were primarily interested in ease and speed when purchasing tickets, 
            but we discovered that customers also enjoyed the option to pick their seats and inspect the theatre layout before purchasing tickets.​</p>
        <p class="para-2">Moreover, we discovered that customers want the opportunity to see trailers and read reviews before choosing on a movie, as well as the ability to receive real-time updates and alerts regarding their ticket purchases and showtimes.
           Overall, the user research assisted us in better understanding the requirements and preferences of our customers.</p>
